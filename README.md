A Common Builder Model
======================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/banjocreek/java-builder.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/banjocreek/java-builder)

Builder support. Models include

- immutable. every change to the builder is captured
  and usable forever
- mutable. shared builder state for multiple contributors


# Versions

This version combines ideas from previous builders scattered
in various projects. While the API is stabilizing, releases
will be called 3.0.x. No compatibilities between versions
with that pattern can be assumed.

The first stable API will be called 3.x (x > 0) and versions
released with that pattern will be backward compatible with
any other 3.x version having smaller x.
